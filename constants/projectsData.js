        name: "Unpaid Interships", 
        description: "When I went on my first tour around Georgia Tech, I remember how my mother's eyes lit up when the tour guide informed us that every employer that came to the Georgia Tech career fair offered a paid internship opportunity. I have always been in the fortunate situation where I did not have to work during college to pay for my tuition, but I have always tried to have a job to help my mother pay for my housing and meals. Recently, the New York Post called attention to the fact that the National Football League, a 15.26 billion dollar organization, is offering unpaid internships for this summer. The public outcry all stemmed from a tweet posted by Jane Slater that detailed the opportunity and its unpaid nature. There was an immediate divide between those who saw the benefits of an unpaid internship and those who considered it to be a product of a persistent socioeconomic divide. On the one hand, there is a response that says that unpaid internship is a foot in a billion dollar door that can lead to infinite amounts of success later. It is an opportunity to network, expand their skillset, and learn about corporate America before graduation. Specifically, many NFL analysts have been responding to the tweet saying that they would have never made it to where they are without an unpaid internship in their field that propelled them to continue on this path or help them have experience to discuss so that they can have a true conversation with a future interviewer. On the other side of the discussion, there are people coming forward who say that unpaid internships are a form of exploitation of the youth who don't know how to look for a paid opportunity. On the other hand, there is a population of young people who do not have the chance to take on an unpaid internship simply because they have to always have income coming in to pay for college. Therefore, this group is unable to ever accept an unpaid opportunity even though they may be just as qualified as the other candidate. Ultimately, it is a move in a positive direction to hold these billion-dollar corporations accountable for their actions, but on a larger scale, to also question the idea of what ramifications the idea of an \"unpaid internship\" could be upholding."

        name: "Joel Jones, Making Connections in Person", 
        description: "Joel Jones is a second year Computer Science major from Atlanta, Georgia. He is originally from the northwestern part of the US, but he moved to live with his aunt and uncle in Georgia for more educational opportunities. Joel started his first year at Georgia Tech amidst the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. He finished his high school career online, then moved into a dorm to start his college education from a laptop. A lot of things looked different for Joel's start to college compared to a 'typical' college experience: he was split from his roommate to live alone, he took all of his classes online, he had to get his food to go and eat in his dorm, and he had next to no in person social interaction.Joel felt it never really seemed like his start to college; the classes online were almost too easy and he couldn't engage with his peers. Though he tried starting conversations online during classes, 'breakout rooms' never really seemed to be the best form of communication. Though he did rush a fraternity, Joel couldn't find a club or organization to help him feel connected to campus. He did appreciate efforts from his RA, but nothing seemed to really stick. Joel didn't really feel apart of college or apart of the Georgia Tech community. Come Fall 2021, students return to campus and classes move back to a more traditional format. Joel was so excited to get a fresh start to his college experience. His biggest point of elation was in person classes. He loves being able to talk to his professors and share a room with his classmates. He already feels a better connection to campus, working as an RA, but he still has room to grow. Interestingly, in Joel's second year first semester, he seems similar to a new first year. He struggles to find buildings on campus and is still looking for clubs to join. However, now that Georgia Tech has shifted toward a more open campus, Joel is able to learn and grow in a way that people typically equate to the first year experience. That said, Joel's first year online was its own unique experience on growth. In limbo between high school and the postcard college experience, Joel learned how important it is to reach out and talk with people. He still shared some of the usual first year experiences like moving away from home and changing his major after taking linear algebra."

        description: "Abigail (Abi) Ivemeyer is a dual degree Masters student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. She started at Georgia Tech pursuing her undergrad in Electrical Engineering in 2017, and she has had many impactful positions in her time on campus, notably the 2020 Ramblin Reck Driver. For Abi, a love of Georgia Tech is a family affair. Abi comes from a family of Tech fans and alumni, so it only seemed right that she attended Georgia Tech herself. She followed in her father’s footsteps in an electrical engineering career at Tech and even cheered on her brother, Bailey, on the football field. Having been surrounded by Georgia Tech spirit and tradition from a young age, Abi wanted to help other students learn about and appreciate Georgia Tech so she got involved in many ways to give back to campus. She joined Ramblin Reck Club in her first year, served as a Wreck Camp counselor, became a Grand Challenges student ambassador, and participated in For the Kids Georgia Tech."
